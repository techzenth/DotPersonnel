              <br>
              An Employment Relationship is evident when the employer has the 
              right to assign additional projects to the worker/employee; the 
              work schedule is determined by the Employer; the individual is paid 
              on a regular basis hourly, weekly or monthly; where the employer 
              recruits or dismisses workers supervised by an individual; where 
              the worker receives employee benefits from the person who pays for 
              the work; where statutory tax is deducted; where the employer instructs 
              the worker; where the employee works on the employer’s premises 
              and is reimbursed for expenses and where the individual has the 
              right to terminate the relationship since independent contractors 
              are normally bound by contracts 1 . </font></p>
            <p><font color="#330066" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
              paper will therefore attempt to highlight seven areas of employment 
              relations beginning with the contract of employment and ending with 
              termination and separation. Deakin and Morris alludes to the point 
              that in Great Britain, “the individual contract has been skilfully 
              refashioned by the courts to take collective bargaining into account 
              while leaving the individual free to negotiate and enforce his own 
              contract, which maybe either more or less advantageous to him than 
              the terms of the collective agreement”. 2 </font></p>
            <p><font color="#330066" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              Fairness at Work Act3 also challenged the trade unions that while 
              securing membership and recognition, their representatives are expected 
              to promote effective dialogue with both employees and employers. 
              Many tests have been applied during the past century to determine 
              the employment relationship but with the new forms of work this 
              will continue to be guided by policies and practices in globalisation.</font></p>

              b) Contract of Employment</b></font></p>
            <p><font color="#330066" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              Common law leaves an employer with the freedom to contract with 
              whomever he chooses and for whatever reason but statute does impose 
              restrictions upon the freedom in the selection and recruiting processes. 
              The breach of some of the provisions attracts criminal sanctions. 
              There have been various arguments as to the relevance or equality 
              of the individual contract of employment, resulting in legislation 
              to protect the weaker party. The contract of employment is based 
              upon the general contract principle of offer and acceptance and 
              a contract is created once the employee turns up for work hence 
              any change of mind by either party can result in a breach of contract 
              and a claim for damage. 4</font></p>
            <p><font color="#330066" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Statute 
              has played a very important role as a source of the terms, which 
              provides separate codes from which employers cannot abrogate since 
              the contract of employment5 . A contract of employment can be made 
              up of implied terms or expressed terms - oral or in writing. Employees 
              owe a number of duties in the employment relationship at common 
              law, which can be applied in the absence of expressed terms. Under 
              the Health and Safety at Work6 , there is an implied term at common 
              law, which shows that the employee owes the employer a duty to use 
              reasonable care, in relation to the performance of his job. This 
              duty of care also extends to vicarious liability as held in the 
              case of <i>Lister v. Romford Ice</i> and <i>Cold Storage Co. Ltd.</i> 
              Both the employer and employee have a mutual duty to maintain trust 
              and confidence as demonstrated in the cases of Secretary of State 
              for Employment v. ASLEF 7; <i>Creswell v. Board</i> of Inland Revenue 
              and <i>Woods v. WM Car Services8 Watkins L.J.</i> held that: “the 
              obdurate refusal of the employee to accept conditions very properly 
              and sensibly being sought to be imposed upon her was unreasonable. 
              Employers must not, in my opinion, be put in a position where through 
              the wrongful refusal of their employees to accept change, they are 
              prevented from introducing improved business methods in furtherance 
              of seeking success for their enterprise”. It is implied in 
              every contract of employment that the employer owes the employee 
              certain duties from which he cannot abrogate.9 </font></p>
            <p><font color="#330066" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Inspite 
              of all the changes that will impact on the contract of employment, 
              the Courts are always willing to look at the way the parties conducted 
              the contract of employment and imply a term, which is reasonable 
              to all parties in the absence of expressed terms. The EC Directives 
              are also imposing a new range of responsibilities and duties on 
              the employer. Other legal instruments within global trading are 
              also impacting in a similar manner, therefore, the contract of employment 
              must be developed with the utmost care and concern for the individual 
              and the organisations good will as well as form part of the policy 
              initiative to ensure harmony at the workplace. Under the Employment 
              Relations Act10, the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) 
              Act11 has been amended. Under Section 13 of this Act, there are 
              several definitions of the worker as well as several classifications 
              and they do not have protection or benefits since they do not qualify 
              to be employees in the absence of a contract of employment. The 
              Employment Relations Act12 amended the law relating to employment, 
              trade unions, employment agencies and businesses while the Government 
              through the Department of Trade and Industry after consultation 
              with the Confederation of British Industries, the Trade Union Congress 
              introduced the white paper ‘Fairness at Work’.</font></p>

            <p><font color="#330066" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
              phase of the employment relationship should provide an easily understood 
              approach to successively ensure that the job description, the application, 
              initial employment, orientation, training and performance monitoring 
              are conducted with the ultimate goal to ensure good employment relations. 
              The results of the hiring process reflect on the firm’s mission, 
              goals, products and/or services, and the effectiveness of work results. 
              The need for a Programmatic Approach to classify, attract, screen, 
              select, orientate, train and evaluate a new hire simultaneously, 
              with the need to put in place the Administrative Approach components 
              that will ensure that the process, action and decision will be well 
              documented, thorough and legal, are important. 13</font></p>
            <p><font color="#330066" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              true test of any employment programme is whether new employees can 
              learn and accept all of the firm’s employment related conditions, 
              become quickly productive, acquire the special skills and behaviours 
              needed, the desire to make more than the minimum contribution to 
              the firm’s goals and embrace and adapt to the operational conditions. 
              People are at the heart of any business and human resource strategy. 
              The “New Firm” of this century will need quality people, 
              therefore the recruiting strategy must be developed in a professional 
              way to meet world standards with specific consideration of the international 
              framework, the movement of people in the context of international 
              trade, enhanced productivity and competitiveness. Since no two organisations 
              are the same, there must be creativity in setting the policies. 
              It is also essential that in setting policies, a framework be established 
              for their administration and review. If the organisation is unionised, 
              the personnel/human resource policies are the subject of collective 
              bargaining and cannot be implemented unilaterally, but must be presented 
              as any other union/management proposal.14 </font></p>
            <p><font color="#330066" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              preventative approach in employment relations begins with the recruitment 
              process. It is important to keep in mind the cost/benefit of a good 
              or bad recruit since hiring the right people can mean (1) a better 
              run operation, (2) better production, (3) fewer people problems, 
              (4) better morale, (5) lower turnover, and (6) less administrative 
              time spent on re-hiring. It is also essential that care be taken 
              in preparation for the selection of candidates. There must be a 
              review of job content, requirements, skills, duties and essential 
              job functions, the essential physical and mental requirements relating 
              to the job description; details of the organisation’s policies 
              and benefits, programmes, involvement of other interested persons; 
              the structure of the interview, the predetermined location, the 
              time frame and list of questions. A check list of activities can 
              also be prepared which would include sources of candidates for selection; 
              advertisements; recruitment and employment agencies; staff leasing 
              agencies, executive search firms, outplacement services, job search 
              consultancies, human resource consultancies, job banks or corporations, 
              career management services, computerised data base services/search 
              engines, specialised trade and professional associations; employment 
              applications, unsolicited applications and resumes, interview ‘checklist’, 
              selection tests, credit checks, arrests/convictions and legal consideration.15

              Compensation and Benefits</font></b></font></p>
            <p><font color="#330066" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Traditionally, 
              there are some principal obligations acquired by each party to an 
              employment contract or relationship. The employer is expected to 
              pay wages; provide work; take reasonable care of the employee; indemnify 
              the employee for expenses and liabilities incurred in the course 
              of employment and treat the employee with courtesy. The employee 
              is expected to render a personal service (by being physically present) 
              take reasonable care in the performance of his duties; obey reasonable 
              instructions from his employer; act in good faith towards his employer 
              and refrain from impeding his employer’s business. At the centre 
              of the employment relationship is how to compensate and administer 
              benefits. It is therefore important that the employee, after selection, 
              be given a written statement including the scale or rate of pay, 
              the intervals at which the payment will be made, the normal hours 
              to be worked, entitlement to holidays, sick pay arrangements, pension 
              scheme arrangements and health benefits.16 </font></p>
            <p><font color="#330066" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
              Compensation represents the prime source of revenue for employees 
              and the value they place on each element of compensation (salary 
              and benefits) is essentially dependent on the ability of each element 
              to meet their needs. In the exchange process, compensation encompasses 
              salary and employee benefits and can be seen as a concrete expression 
              of exchange between the employee and the organisation. Belcher and 
              Aitcheson17 and Mahoney18 believe this transaction has a number 
              of facets including economic, psychological, sociological, political 
              and ethical. From an organisation’s perspective, the exchange 
              is designed to recruit and retain the necessary labour and to elicit 
              employee behaviour capable of fulfilling its mission. The individual 
              objective may be to satisfy different needs, eg. Maslows 19</font></p>
            <p><font color="#330066" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
              is important that Compensation and Benefits be managed based on 
              policies relating to internal consistency, competitiveness, employee 
              contribution and the nature of the compensation administration. 
              The concept of managing compensation has been through three stages, 
              first on the concept of ‘job’ where job evaluation techniques 
              were developed, then the social science phase of the 50s and 60s 
              when without changing that jobs were important the attention focused 
              on people with the present focus being on strategy – strategic 
              compensation management. 20</font></p>

            <p><font color="#330066" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Diversity 
              is expected to assist in the creation of high performing organisations 
              through targeted culture change strategies since organisation culture 
              is a powerful dictator of behaviour. This change usually over time 
              results in greater commitment, self-confidence, ethical behaviour 
              and a reduced level of stress at the workplace. Diversity also has 
              the capacity to remove equality from a generalised approach to the 
              identification of individual character, integrity, maturity, experience 
              of personal relationships and other elements of life profile since 
              any or all these qualities may be present in either sex.21</font></p>
            <p><font color="#330066" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Diversity 
              is a cultural and individual approach; it shows an awareness of 
              difference in old and young, black and white, skilled and unskilled, 
              part-time and full-time, long-term and short-term employees, rich 
              and poor, Jews and Gentiles, educated and illiterate, from North 
              and South, rural and urban, height and weight, and speed of learning 
              and communication and is directed at everyone in the workplace. 
              Diversity uses many labels to accomplish the same goals and everyone 
              in the organisation is involved since it shows an interest in self-worth 
              and enhanced productivity. It is a proactive approach to ensure 
              continuous awareness through education; a strategic policy initiative 
              in individual organisations; looks at all categories; combinations 
              and levels of employees; a team-based approach focused on merit 
              and differences within groups; a broad based approach relating to 
              employees’ future and customers; it encourages flexibility 
              and openness and recognises the significance of ‘difference’ 
              in everyone. 22</font></p>

              in labour mobility, work experience, hours worked, earnings level 
              and other social factors have impacted on the employment of both 
              men and women, theorists have tried to explain women’s subordination

              of social engineering authors were of special interest in my quest 
              to conclude that diversity is a strategic management concept, which 
              will merge with equal opportunities for relevance in employment:</font></p>

              Employer would be guided by the Equal Opportunities Commission Code
